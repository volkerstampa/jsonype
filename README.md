# jsonype

## Usage

See [documentation](https://jsonype.readthedocs.io/v0.4.0/).

## Similar tools

- [typedload](https://github.com/ltworf/typedload) is also a package to 
  "Load and dump json-like data into typed data structures in Python3". It uses 
  a less permissive license.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) is a widely used data validation library for Python.
  It is often used for converting to and from JSON, but offers much more than that. Unlike in case of
  jsonype classes that should be converted from/to JSON need to inherit from a base class (`BaseModel`).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11:
  Can be installed with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):
  - `pyenv install 3.11`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) >=1.2: Can be installed with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):
  - `pipx install poetry`

  See [Poetry's documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
  for alternative installation options, but make sure that poetry plugins can be installed.
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for building documentation
